<p>The game itself is still under development, we will strive to make a complete gaming experience.     </p>
<p>We have created a complete world view and story framework for the game, and carefully designed characters, story, and gameplay. We hope you will enjoy it.    </p>

<p>I use Unity3D as the game engine.<br>Also includes these functionalities:  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>URP<br>To make the scene more beautiful.<br>Add ShaderGraph to create special render effect(like the water and the shadow of water reflected on the wall behind)</p>
</li>
<li><p>UniRx<br>Reactive state control.<br>Script sequence control.</p>

<p>Each title was produced end-to-end by myself—from the initial planning stage, through development, to the final release. During the planning phase, I worked under the guidance of a planner, but the full production and publishing process was carried out independently by me.</p>

<h2 id="Merge-Spear"><a href="#Merge-Spear" class="headerlink" title="Merge Spear"></a>Merge Spear</h2><p>Among all these games, I like the “Merge Spear” the most so I am going to give you some details about the game here.<br><img src="/images/creek-river-hyper-spear.gif" alt="">   </p>
<p>In this game, players choose a suitable spearhead, combine it into a weapon, and then face off against enemies—kind of like a fighting game.   </p>
<p>I enjoyed working on this project because the gameplay felt fresh and engaging, and I had a lot of fun implementing the different attack effects.   </p>
<p>For the camera system, I didn’t rely on any plugins but instead wrote my own scripts, and I’m very satisfied with the result.</p>

<p>This is a game demo using </p>
<ul>
<li>Frontend: <code>Pixi.js</code>, <code>React (Next.js)</code> and <code>GSAP</code></li>
<li>Backend: <code>Node</code>, <code>Express</code> and <code>Socket.io</code></li>
<li>DB: <code>Redis</code> as data cache</li>
<li>Construct and deploy: <code>Docker</code>, <code>Nginx</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For this game, I have designed the whole system, the art base and picked up the technologies I needed.</p>
<p>I have finished the programming part all by myself.</p>
<p>One of my friend has draw the most of the sprites for me. (<strong>A great thanks here</strong>)   </p>
<p>For the demo server, I have bought a VPS from <code>Linode</code> and built a <code>docker + nginx</code> deploy flow. I was planed to use <code>AWS</code> or <code>Google Cloud</code>, however I found it is a little bit waste to deploy such a small project using them. Also I can learn more by using a brand new server out of box.    </p>
<p>I am still working on improving the game. I hope you will enjoy it.</p>

<p>This is a game demo using CocosCreator. I have draw the sprites and programmed the whole stuff. Click to start. Once you clicked, your toma will go forward to across the road. If you click the left side of the screen, your toma will turn left and stop (as it is stupid, not able to walk and see in the same time), meanwhile you shall not see the right side. Vice versa. </p>

<p>The game’s title comes from a famous nonsensical phrase in “Hajimemashite Matsuo desu.” For convenience, we refer to it simply as <code>pachofa</code>.<br><img src="/images/pachofa.png" alt="">    </p>
<p>It is designed as a casual idle game where players can collect mushrooms during short play sessions and gradually evolve stars and civilizations. Every day, a new chick can also be obtained.<br><img src="/images/pachofa-1.png" alt="">    </p>
<p>I was involved from the very beginning—taking part in the planning phase, building the program architecture, implementing gameplay systems, and even contributing to animation production.</p>

Although this was different from what I originally expected, I gained valuable experience in online game development, as I was responsible for the entire process from front-end to back-end on my own.</p>

<h2 id="拳極"><a href="#拳極" class="headerlink" title="拳極"></a>拳極</h2><p><img src="/images/kengoku-1.png" alt=""><br>The project I worked on was a game called Ken Goku (拳極). By the time I joined, the game had already been released and had been in live operation for quite some time. It is a combat-focused social game themed around Japanese yakuza culture. Players can progress through main story missions, recruit underlings, form alliances, engage in PvP, and purchase or upgrade equipment.  </p>
<p>Here is the official site of the game: <a href="https://kengoku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://kengoku.com/</a></p>
<p>The game is heavily social, offering features such as chat, greetings, friend-making, sparring, gift-giving, and cooperative battles. In addition, it includes extensive in-app purchases and gacha systems, which made the backend implementation particularly complex.   </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UB5HQs8R_DE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>   

<p>(Here ↑ is the official game trailer) </p>
<p>I was responsible for full-stack development, covering both frontend and backend. My main tasks included bug fixing, feature updates, and maintaining seasonal operations.  </p>
<h3 id="Technical-Details"><a href="#Technical-Details" class="headerlink" title="Technical Details"></a>Technical Details</h3><p>In this project, we have used these tools for the development:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Communication<ul>
<li>Slack</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Task Management<ul>
<li>Backlog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Client<ul>
<li>Unity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Backend<ul>
<li>AWS<ul>
<li>Lambda （nodejs）</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>DynamoDB</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Firebase</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CI/CD<ul>
<li>UnityCloudBuild</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the game’s architecture was also quite complex, I created a simple diagram to illustrate its structure.<br><img src="/images/kengoku-diagram.svg" width="400" />   </p>
<p>The architecture connects a Unity client to <code>AWS Lambda</code> APIs, which interact with both <code>RDS</code> (MySQL) and <code>DynamoDB</code>.<br>The client can access <code>DynamoDB</code> in a one-way direction but cannot modify it.<br><code>Firebase</code> is used to push notification to the client.<br>The client gets the <code>Asset Bundle</code> from <code>S3</code>.   </p>
<p>There is also a <code>CMS</code>, where the management team can modify DB and S3 directly.  </p>
<p>The system supports multiple environments (DEV/TEST/STG/PROD) for smooth development and live operations.</p>

<p>Isn’t it annoying that your scene file hidden in the project hierarchy and you have to use the search bar to find the scene you wanna use.   </p>
<p>In the begining I thought that I can find a good plugin for this, but no, either are they too hard to use or they are expensive.   </p>
<p>So I thought, why not create my own one. So, boom, voila, the <code>Sleepy Scene Tool</code> is here:  </p>
