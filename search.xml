<p>The game itself is still under development, we will strive to make a complete gaming experience.     </p>
<p>We have created a complete world view and story framework for the game, and carefully designed characters, story, and gameplay. We hope you will enjoy it.    </p>

<p>I use Unity3D as the game engine.<br>Also includes these functionalities:  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>URP<br>To make the scene more beautiful.<br>Add ShaderGraph to create special render effect(like the water and the shadow of water reflected on the wall behind)</p>
</li>
<li><p>UniRx<br>Reactive state control.<br>Script sequence control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>DoTween<br>tween animation.<br>For example the camera movement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cinemation<br>Camera control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spine Unity Runtime<br>For implement the spine animations I have created.  </p>

<h2 id="Project-Structure"><a href="#Project-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Project Structure"></a>Project Structure</h2><hr>
<p>This is a game demo using </p>
<ul>
<li>Frontend: <code>Pixi.js</code>, <code>React (Next.js)</code> and <code>GSAP</code></li>
<li>Backend: <code>Node</code>, <code>Express</code> and <code>Socket.io</code></li>
<li>DB: <code>Redis</code> as data cache</li>
<li>Construct and deploy: <code>Docker</code>, <code>Nginx</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For this game, I have designed the whole system, the art base and picked up the technologies I needed.</p>
<p>I have finished the programming part all by myself.</p>
<p>One of my friend has draw the most of the sprites for me. (<strong>A great thanks here</strong>)   </p>
<p>For the demo server, I have bought a VPS from <code>Linode</code> and built a <code>docker + nginx</code> deploy flow. I was planed to use <code>AWS</code> or <code>Google Cloud</code>, however I found it is a little bit waste to deploy such a small project using them. Also I can learn more by using a brand new server out of box.    </p>
<p>I am still working on improving the game. I hope you will enjoy it.</p>

<p>Isn’t it annoying that your scene file hidden in the project hierarchy and you have to use the search bar to find the scene you wanna use.   </p>
<p>In the begining I thought that I can find a good plugin for this, but no, either are they too hard to use or they are expensive.   </p>
<p>So I thought, why not create my own one. So, boom, voila, the <code>Sleepy Scene Tool</code> is here:  </p>

</p>

<p>This is a game demo using CocosCreator. I have draw the sprites and programmed the whole stuff. Click to start. Once you clicked, your toma will go forward to across the road. If you click the left side of the screen, your toma will turn left and stop (as it is stupid, not able to walk and see in the same time), meanwhile you shall not see the right side. Vice versa. </p>

<p>Each title was produced end-to-end by myself—from the initial planning stage, through development, to the final release. During the planning phase, I worked under the guidance of a planner, but the full production and publishing process was carried out independently by me.</p>

<h2 id="Merge-Spear"><a href="#Merge-Spear" class="headerlink" title="Merge Spear"></a>Merge Spear</h2><p>Among all these games, I like the “Merge Spear” the most so I am going to give you some details about the game here.   </p>
<p>In this game, players choose a suitable spearhead, combine it into a weapon, and then face off against enemies—kind of like a fighting game.   </p>
<p>I enjoyed working on this project because the gameplay felt fresh and engaging, and I had a lot of fun implementing the different attack effects.   </p>
<p>For the camera system, I didn’t rely on any plugins but instead wrote my own scripts, and I’m very satisfied with the result.</p>
